Introdcution of the task
The Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset[1] is an image-based dataset that includes MRI images of the human brain. The grayscale pictures are manually classified into four groups based on the type of tumor. The assignment's purpose is to apply machine learning skills to real-world challenges. Task A is a binary task to create a classifier to determine whether or not the MRI pictures include a tumor. Task B is a multi-class question to identify the tumor kinds in each MRI picture. For the models, one deep learning model and one non-deep learning model are recommended.

Organization of files
IN image file, there are 3000 MRi grey images
label.csv is the label of each image 
svm.py is the main programme of svm model
vgg.py is the main programme of vgg model
image_0002,jpg is the test image for vgg.py model


before run the code, it is necessary to install packages eg, keras,numpy,sklearn,matpolotlib,OpenCV,pickle.
then use shift+command+e to run code line by line and we can get the results
